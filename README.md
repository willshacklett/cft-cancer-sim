# Cancer Project

A toy cancer dynamics simulator built on **GV (scalar strain / risk)** and **CFT-inspired constraint coupling**.

This project is intentionally simple: it demonstrates how **constraint failure** drives divergence between healthy and cancerous systems over time.

## GV Trajectory: Healthy vs Cancer

## What this is

- A **baseline HealthyCell model**
- A **CancerCell model** that exploits weakened constraints
- A **GV (God Variable) score** that rises as strain accumulates  
  (energy loss, damage, arrest failures, uncontrolled division)
- A reproducible simulation that **executes, plots, and saves artifacts**

This is not a medical claim.  
It is a **systems-level demonstration**.
